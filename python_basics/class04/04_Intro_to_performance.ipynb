    "We have learned a bunch of techniques to write python code and functions, and it's clear there are multiple ways to solve a problem using a python program. For example, you can sort a list or exhaust a sequence using multiple ways. Usually, different methods or algorithms have their own pros and cons, and you can try to pick the appropriate one for your specific problem. But how do we measure \"appropriate\"? We usually use the term `algorithm analysis` to describe the complexity of differenet algorithms to find the most efficient one for a problem.\n",
