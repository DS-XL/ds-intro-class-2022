# ds-class-intro

Welcome to the intro-level DS class, where we will learn about python basics and how to use python for exploratory data analysis. Hope you'll enjoy the class and learn something from it.

### 0. Get started - 
If you can, try to go throug the following reading and set up your local environment before class:

- [Anaconda set up](https://github.com/emma-data-works/ds-class-intro/blob/master/python_basics/class01/Anaconda_setup.md) 
- [Git introduction](https://github.com/emma-data-works/ds-class-intro/blob/master/python_basics/class01/git_setup.md)
- [Set up you forked repo for commit and push + Homework submisstion instructions](https://github.com/emma-data-works/ds-class-intro/blob/master/Git-setup-and-hw-instruction.md)

### 1. Python basics
You can run python in different settings, for example, you can use `jupyter` notebook for interactive exploration, use interpreter in command line by typing `python` in terminal (you'll see `>>>` prompt appear), or run python script in command line by `python <your_script>.py`. We will be using notebooks for the class as it's easy to follow with [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and easy to interact with.
