# 2. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

# example: numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
# output:
# >>> Number of even numbers : 4
# >>> Number of odd numbers : 5

# 3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 0 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# Expected Output :
# >>> fizzbuzz
# >>> 1
# >>> 2
# >>> fizz
# >>> 4
# >>> buzz
# >>> ...

# 4. Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number greater than 150 stop the loop iteration

# examples: list1 = [12, 15, 32, 42, 55, 75, 122, 132, 150, 180, 200]
# output:
# >>> 15
# >>> 55
# >>> 75
# >>> 150
